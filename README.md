# Marinara

A site to help list, and search thru, all the open source 3D printers, firmware, slicers, and accessories I can find.

# Motivation

Simply put, I want to try and keep track of the open source printing ecosystem, but it's too scattered to do manually.
By piling projects together, I'll at least have a vague hope of remembering the different projects.

# Local Usage

Once this hits a version 1.0, I'll host it somewhere for real, but until then, this will only be usable locally.
Fortunately, the process of running this locally should be pretty simple!

This is a `deno` application, so you'll first want to
[actually install deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation) on your system.

Next, you'll want to clone this repo to your machine.

Then, using the command line of your choice, you'll want to navigate to the repo, and run `deno task start` which will
compile the code, and launch a server to launch the application on.

lastly, navigate to server (normally `localhost:xxxx`)
