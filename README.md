# Marinara

A web-app to help list, and search thru, all the open source 3D printers, firmware, slicers, and accessories I can find.

[Hosted on Deno.dev](https://marinara.deno.dev/)

# Motivation

Simply put, I want to try and keep track of the open source printing ecosystem, but it's too scattered to do manually.
By piling projects together, I'll at least have a vague hope of remembering the different projects.

# Local Usage

Once this hits a version 1.0, I'll host it somewhere for real, but until then, this will only be usable locally.
Fortunately, the process of running this locally should be pretty simple!

This is a `deno` application, so you'll first want to
[actually install deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation) on your system.

Next, you'll want to clone this repo to your machine.

Then, using the command line of your choice, you'll want to navigate to the repo, and run `deno task start` which will
compile the code, and launch a server to launch the application on.

lastly, navigate to server (normally `localhost:xxxx`)

# Special Thanks and Notes

Special thanks goes out to Dr Adrian Bowyer, and all of the maintainers, contributors, and users of the RepRap project.
The RepRap project is the giant whose shoulders we stand upon today. Without their efforts, commitments, and effort the
3D Printing community would be nothing like what it is today.

Special thanks also goes out to all the people who contribute to all of projects listed here (and the uncounted projects
that should be here, but I've missed). The 3d printing community's commitment to Free and/or Open Source software and
hardware has allowed countless people to create and learn, and should be an inspiration to us all.

Many of these maintainers have Patreon, Ko-fi, paypal, etc or have official partnerships with vendors like
[Fabreeko](https://www.fabreeko.com/),[west3d](https://west3d.com/),
[MatterHackers](https://www.matterhackers.com/s/store?q=LDO) or other storefronts.

If you feel comfortable doing so, please check with individual maintainers to see how they'd prefer you to support then.
