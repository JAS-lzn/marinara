# Marinara

A site to help list, and search thru, all the open source 3D printers, firmware, slicers, and accessories I can find.

# Modivation

Simply put, there are so many different Open Source 3D printing projects being developed for me to keep track of. I'm
making this to help organize all the info scattered around the internet so that it's easy to find and sort thru.

# Local Usage

Once this hits a version 1.0, I'll host it somewhere for real, but until then, this will only be usable locally. Fortunately, the process of running this locally should be pretty simple!

This is a `deno` application, so you'll first want to [actually install deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation) on your system.

Next, you'll want to clone this repo to your machine.

Then, using the command line of your choice, you'll want to navigate to the repo, and run 
```deno task start```
which will compile the code, and launch a server to launch the application on.

lastly, navigate to server (normally `localhost:xxxx`)
